# Machine Learning Models

This directory contains the computer vision models and AI components for the Macro Tracker application.

## Models (Planned)

### Food Recognition Model
- **Purpose**: Identify food items from images
- **Technology**: TensorFlow/PyTorch with pre-trained models
- **Features**: 
  - Multi-class food classification
  - Portion size estimation
  - Ingredient detection

### Macro Calculation Engine
- **Purpose**: Calculate nutritional information
- **Technology**: Custom algorithms + nutrition databases
- **Features**:
  - Calorie calculation
  - Macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fat)
  - Micro-nutrient estimation

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Cloud APIs
- Google Cloud Vision API
- Azure Computer Vision
- AWS Rekognition
- OpenAI Vision API

### Option 2: Custom Models
- TensorFlow.js for client-side processing
- Flask/FastAPI backend for model serving
- Docker containers for deployment

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Planning Phase** ðŸš§

The ML models will be developed after the frontend and backend are complete. Initial development will focus on integrating existing cloud APIs for rapid prototyping.
