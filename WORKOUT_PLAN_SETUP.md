# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Workout Plan Generation with LangGraph

## üöÄ Overview

The Macro Tracker now includes a sophisticated workout plan generation system using LangGraph (via LangChain4j). The workout plan generation uses a 4-step workflow that provides detailed, personalized workout routines based on user preferences and fitness goals.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Compile the project
mvn clean compile

# Start the Spring Boot application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the React application
npm start
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### LangGraph Workflow

The workout plan generation uses a 4-step LangGraph workflow:

1. **Analysis Step**: Analyzes user fitness profile and requirements
2. **Structure Step**: Creates workout structure and split
3. **Detailed Step**: Generates detailed workout routines
4. **Final Step**: Compiles progression plan and tips

### Key Components

- **`LangGraphWorkoutPlanService`**: Main service implementing the workflow
- **`WorkoutPlanRequest`**: DTO for workout plan requests
- **`WorkoutController`**: REST API endpoint
- **Frontend Form**: Comprehensive workout planning interface
